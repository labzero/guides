# Writing a README
All code repos should include a README that gives a summary of what the code does and provides necessary instructions for setup and use.

## Relevant sections
The following sections are commonly used and can serve as a starting point for a README.

### Overview
The README should start with a brief overview that summarizes the use or purpose of the repository. If your introduction is not self-explanatory to a new user, consider referencing any related third-party libraries or other concepts that might be unfamiliar.

### Requirements
If there are any environment prerequisites or other steps that are required for installation of the repo, list them before the installation step.

### Installation
Include the commands needed to install the project and any dependencies. Be sure to include any environment configuration steps. List any requirements for database setup.

### Usage
Include the commands needed to run the code (in the development environment). If the user can pass in options, list out options and flags.

If there are multiple ways to run the code (for instance, running the code offline using a local server versus connected to a dev database), discuss what is required to run the code with different settings. Include example commands and output where relevant.

Be sure to include any commands to run tests and linting. 

If the code might commonly return an error, consider adding an error/troubleshooting section.

### Build and Deployment
If relevant, include build and deployment instructions. This might include build commands and configuration that the user will have to set up.

### Other
Other commonly included sections are *contributing*, *acknowledgments*, and *license*.

## Formatting
Use formatting options correctly to ensure accessibility. Header levels should appropriately divide sections and subsections, and there should be a single h1 top-level header.

A README should provide enough information for an interested user to run the code, but should not be overly detailed or cluttered. Additional docs can be useful when a detailed explanation of the code is necessary.
