# Overview
Showing your work and the work of your team to a broader audience uses some different skills than we might use when building products. Let's talk about the most important tips we keep in mind when running demos. 

# Be prepared
Go through all of the delivered and accepted tickets to make sure you know what was done and how to show it. 

Take notes to use during the demo so that you can cruise through the delivered work as a story. Some back and forth is okay but you should try to minimize it. 

The main trick is to try to tell the audience about as much work done on a screen as you can while still keeping the story simple.

We often do a pre-demo meeting for 15-30 minutes where the product owner and dev team meets to review the work for the "release". This is a great place for the demoer to do their homework with the other devs and product owner there to answer questions on how to demo things.

# Connect with the audience
The demo is the time to show the value that has been delivered. Tell a story and assume that folks need more context than you and your teammates would use.

Know your audience and adjust your demo to cater specifically to them. If you are demoing to non-technical people, don't dive into the weeds of how something was done, or why it was difficult or easy to implement. Instead, focus on the value that has been added to the product or user, for example.

Make sure the audience is with you. It is okay to look at them, in the eye, and is encouraged. :) 

# Keep it organized
Someone other than the demoer should be playing scribe for the demo, but if not make sure to jot larger conversations down for later discussion. Don't let some feedback from the audience turn into a several minute group design session. 

# Check yourself
There are a handful of common things that a demoer can do and say that don't show well. Be mindful to avoid things like:

* Extra mouse clicks 
* Fast or extra scrolling 
* "There's not much to show you today."
* "We didn't get as much done as we wanted to."
* "...but there's nothing for me to really show you.."

# Best practices
* Arrive 5-10 minutes early to setup your AV.
* Turn on your computer's [Do Not Disturb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxHMpviBlaY) mode
* Close all communication apps, like Slack, Messages, Email
* [Draw a circle around navigation elements](http://cl.ly/0i3w1b1U143I) with your mouse before clicking to draw attention to where the action is happening and give the audience time to follow along.
* Zoom in (âŒ˜ +) to a level that makes text readable to everybody. (Especially when showing things like a Pivotal backlog)

# Take turns
The demoer role should be shared by taking turns each week to encourage new styles and a safe place for learning.
