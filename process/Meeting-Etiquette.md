## We Are Prepared
_If we're not early, we're late._

* We show up to meetings early so we can dial in and start up conference lines before our meeting starts.
* We create an agenda for meetings we organize
* When we share our screen:
 * We close out of, or minimize, any windows and tabs that are not pertinent to the meeting.
 * We close out of any messaging applications (Slack, Mail, etc), and put our OS X or Growl notifications into "Do Not Disturb" mode.
 * We perform any required A/V setup before the meeting starts (Connecting to G2M, Turning on TV, etc).

## We Are Productive
