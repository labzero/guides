# Sprint Review

## What is a sprint review?

A regular demonstration of the value delivered in a sprint.

## Why is a sprint review needed?

Stakeholders and interested parties see actual progress being made, and give feedback early and often into the product and outcome.

## When does the sprint review take place?

At the end of every sprint.

## Who attends the sprint review?

**Preparation** - The [demo script](../project_kickoff/sprint_review_template.md) is prepared by the Product Manager and shared with the squad before the demo.

**Attendees** - All relevant stakeholders are invited to the demo. The whole squad attends the demo.

**Demo** 
- At the beginning of the demo the Product Manager provides context.
- An Engineer then demos the work delivered (ticket by ticket, as listed in the script). Take turns each demo so the whole engineering team is able to practice their demo skills.
- A member of the squad takes notes on feedback.

**Optional Design Demo** - Many teams find it valuable to give a preview of approved, ticketed designs that are slated for delivery. Other teams may use this time to communicate highlights from design research. This section is intended to give the team visibility into design tasks and should be kept brief.


## Demo Best Practices
- **Focus on value** - The demo is the time to show the value that has been delivered. Center your story on value rather than tasks. Connect the story to the persona who would see value from this work.
- **Know your audience** - Adjust your demo to cater specifically to them. If you are demoing to a non-technical or mixed audience, don't dive into the weeds of how something was done, or why it was difficult or easy to implement. Instead, focus on the value that has been added to the product or user, for example.
- **Reduce distractions** - Keep your screen focused on what the audience needs to see.
  - Turn on your computer's [Do Not Disturb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxHMpviBlaY) mode
  - Close all communication apps, like Slack, Messages, Email
  - If sharing a broswer window, limit the open tabs to those relevant to the demo
  - Draw a circle around navigation elements with your mouse before clicking to draw attention to where the action is happening and give the audience time to follow along.
  - Zoom in (âŒ˜ +) to a level that makes text readable to everybody. (Especially when showing challenging to read items like a backlog)
