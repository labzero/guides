# Design Team Charter

As product designers, we make this promise to our product & engineering collaborators:


#### Be an active partner in clarifying why. 
Actively engage in making sense of the problem.


#### Foster alignment. 
Use design tools to improve the team's alignment around and understanding of the problem.


#### Creatively and purposefully explore solutions. 
Explore solutions that clearly and creatively respond to shared understanding of the business and customer pain points and desired outcomes.


#### Advocate for the user. 
Be able to frame how designs relate to the user journey and the user's thoughts, actions, and feelings.


#### Be mindful of value/effort trade-offs. 
Recognize that design doesn't exist in a vacuum. Know when and how to focus your effort in service of project priorities.


#### Care about the details. 
Anticipate edge cases and design for them. Develop clear and consistent guidelines to foster efficient iterative delivery.


#### Work collaboratively. 
We value open communication with our teams to answer questions, clarify design thinking, get feedback and design solutions. We aren't designing in a silo.
