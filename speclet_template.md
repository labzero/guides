# Lab Zero Speclet Template
To learn more about speclets, view the playbook on Lab Zeroâ€™s GitHub Repo [here](https://github.com/labzero/guides/blob/master/process/speclet_playbook.md).

## Summary
This is your space to clarify who the primary customer is, what their core problems/goals are and why the business believes the effort is a worthy investment. 

Tips: Use short paragraphs. Help the team understand where we are today (the opportunity) and where we want to end up (the goal). Do not propose solutions. Keep this to half a page.

## Desired Outcomes
Use a numbered list to define no more than three key opportunities or goals that must be addressed and the signals which will tell you that you achieved your desired outcome.

1. Top priority outcome
   1. Quantitative measurement of addressing the problem
   1. Qualitative measurement of addressing the problem
1. Secondary priority outcome
   1. Quantitative measurement of addressing the problem

## Out of Scope
* Bad solution idea
   * Brief thought on why it can wait until there is a clear customer signal for this solution
* Potential area of feature creep on a core goal
   * Brief thought on why this should be prioritized after we achieve the core goal
* Good idea, but should be addressed later

## Personas Scratchpad
* List of folks likely involved or impacted by this experience and a sentence about the role they perform. 
* Link to persona docs or user research.
