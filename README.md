# Lab Zero Guides
Ahoy! You are welcome to access Lab Zero's guides for our best practices for processes, playbooks, languages and tools.

**If this is your first time here we recommend checking out the [Github Pages site](https://guides.labzero.com) or starting with [index.md](index.md).**

## This README

This README.md describes how to write for and update the Lab Zero Guides site.  If you're here to see site content, **we recommend [visiting the site directly](https://guides.labzero.com)**.  If you're here to update or add a guide, *welcome*, you're in the right place :-)

The Lab Zero Guides site is a Github Pages site.  It is automatically generated from the Markdown files in this (the guides) repository.

This README file will **not** show in the Github Pages site.  The `index.md` is shown instead.  Please see `index.md` for the root page of the site.

## Writing

When adding a new page simply create a new `.md` file!  Then you can proceed to write your article.  When you're ready, add a link on the main `index.md` page.

After you're done open a PR.  Once the PR is merged it will automatically show up on the site (~3min).  Please double-check that it looks correct.

### Markdown

Markdown pages here use kramdown + some Jekyll & theme based enhancements.  Kramdown is very similar to Github flavored markdown but there are some small differences like:

* URLs are not automatically converted to links. (Use the `[text](http://url)` syntax instead.)
* Links to a specific part of a page (e.g. `#heading-1`) must be in lower case.  (GFM allows mixed case)
* You can automatically generate a Table of Contents for a long page. (see below)

The first `h1` or `#` will automatically become the page title.  You can override this with some `headmatter` (see that section below).

#### Links

Use relative links to other pages.  Don't use github based links.  In general internal links should not start with `http`.  Instead they should either start with a directory or a file name.  External links should start with `https://`.  Links to other guides should end in `.md`, not `.html`.

These rules ensure the links work from the both the github markdown side, and are properly converted to HTML links for the guides website.

*Don't:*
```md
- [How to Write User Stories](https://github.com/labzero/guides/blob/master/product_design/how_we_write_user_stories.md)
- [How to conduct a presentation](process/presentation.html)
- [File in the same directory](/languages/sibling-document.md)
- [Our Website](labzero.com)
```

Do:
```md'
- [How to Write User Stories](/product_design/how_we_write_user_stories.md)
- [How to conduct a presentation](/process/presentation.md)
- [File in the same directory](sibling-document.md)
- [Our Website](https://labzero.com)
```


For intra-page links to headings (e.g. `my-page#some-heading`).  Use the heading name in all lower case with dashes for spaces.

Example:

```md
If this page is `meetings.md`, one can link to the section below like:
[online meetings](meetings.md#conducting-an-online-meeting)


### Conducting an Online Meeting
```

#### Images

* Place images in assets/images
* Reference them using their root relative URL.
* As with links, don't use the github or full site name

Don't:
```
https://github.com/labzero/guides/blob/master/assets/images/lz-logo.svg
```

Do:
```
assets/images/lz-logo.svg
```

#### file naming

Any file named with the extension `.md` or `.html` is automatically included in the site.  You can link directly to it.  Other file types may or may not require custom config.

#### Table of Contents

You can have Jekyll automatically generate a table of contents for you.  Where you want the TOC add the following markdown:

```md
* list to be automatically populated with TOC by Jekyll
{:toc}
```

#### adding `headmatter`

Headmatter is a special type of configuration placed at the top of a file.  Jekyll uses this to set or control certain document properties.

**It is optional for nearly all pages**  However, here are a few pieces of headmatter you might choose to use:

```
---
title: The differences between Crocodiles and Alligators
layout: page
---
```

The above sets the article title (the 1st `h1` if unset).  And it switches to the `page` layout.  The `page` layout does *not* display the "Pages" section with related pages at the bottom.

## Technology

This a Github Pages site built with Github's automatic Jekyll setup.

In short you're looking at:

[github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [hydejack (theme)](https://hydejack.com/docs/) + kramdown (md parser).

### Deployment

Deployment is automatic when a new commit is merged to the master branch.  It is performed by a Github action with no customization.

### Config

Most of the config lives in [_config.yml](/_config.yml).  Let's try to keep config specific comments there.

Worth noting: the sidebar and footer links are both in the config.

### Running the site locally

This is not supported.  Github has instructions for doing this but we haven't set up the repo for it.  (Attempting to keep the repo easy to use for all team members.)
